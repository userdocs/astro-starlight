:::tip[Just use docker]
The preferred and recommended build platform is Alpine Linux and the recommended method is via docker. It will just make things easier.
:::

:::caution[Assumptions]
The guide will assume you are using docker, with example commands that are either one liners or from within the container.
:::

:::danger
Don't run this directly on the host system unless you know what you are doing. It's not recommended and the build will probably fail.

‚≠ê When you are familiar with the script you can do anything you want with a one liner. It's pretty simple to use.

### Host - execute script

To execute the script use this command:

```bash
chmod +x ~/qbt.sh # make it executable
```

```bash
~/qbt.sh
```

<Advanced>

:::note
Please see the [switches and flags summary](./build-help?id=switches-and-flags-summarised) to see what options you can pass and how to use them
:::

You can modify the installation command by editing this part of the docker command.

```bash
bash -s all
```

For example, to use `ICU` using `-i`, `-c` to trigger cmake and in turn activate Qt6 and optimise for the system CPU using `-o`:

```bash
bash -s all -i -c -o
```
