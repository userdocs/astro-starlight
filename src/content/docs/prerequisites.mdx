### Prerequisite Check list

If you want self host you need to be able to meet these conditions on your host in order to use the script.

:::caution[Supported host build platforms]

✅ Debian: `Bullseye` `Bookworm`

✅ Ubuntu: `Focal` `Jammy` `Mantic`

✅ Alpine: `3.10` or greater

✅ WSL2 + docker images of the above hosts(recommended)

✅ WSL2 directly using the supported hosts (not recommended if you actively use the image)

:::

:::caution[Bash Shell]
✅ This is 100% a modern bash shell script and it requires having access to bash to run it.
:::

:::caution[sudo or root privileges]
✅ The script needs to install some system dependencies in order to proceed and if you do not have permission or access to do this or no access to docker to use a container you must find a more suitable host environment.
:::

:::caution[Emulation requirements]

✅ If you build using Qt6 you will need to have these dependencies installed on the host, [qemu and binmtfs](glossary/qemu)
